# Alaska_Elasmo_M

Cindy Tribuzio, Beth Matta, Kathrin Bayer

Objective:  Update natural mortality (M) estimates for elasmobranch species in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands.

Methods:  Conduct literature review for the species of interest. Use AFSC fishery and survey ages to get a range of 'longevity' or tmax estimates, when available. Select an appropriate subset of natural mortality estimators based on the data available for each species and the appropriateness of the estimator method. Use code developed in Jason Cope's Natural Mortality Tool to estimate a range of natural mortalities for each species.
